# DVA5
CityRail DVA/Plasma Screen Emulator

A few years back I wrote a program to make your own DVA announcements. In my spare time I wrote a new version of it. The new version is written using Java so it can run on Mac, Windows or Linux.

Set up a departure screen showing your regular commute, create wacky announcements, enhance your model train layout, or have your computer display an unusual screensaver with this realistic reproduction.

### Features
- Runs on Mac, Windows or Linux; x64 (e.g. Intel/AMD) or ARM64 (e.g. Apple M1/M2, Raspberry Pi) processors.
- Original, full-quality audio files for Sydney and Melbourne networks.
- Every version of Sydney's departure screens, with accompanying announcements.
- An expansive library of sound bites to create your own custom announcements.
- Manual mode or current timetable from Transport for NSW's GTFS feed.
- Supports multiple monitors and announcement styles
- Screensaver mode on Windows
