# This file controls the substitution of one station name for another when
# generating an announcement from the indicator board. This is needed when
# the timetable's station name does not match the available announcement
# sound files.
#
# Entries format: A,B,C
# When constructing an announcement, A will be replaced with B. If C is
# supplied, the substitution will only occur if the voice library name
# matches C.
